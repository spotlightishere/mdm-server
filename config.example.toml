[service]
# The address you'd like this service to bind to.
# This can be either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
# For example, set 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces, port 80 and 443.

# Format example: 127.0.0.1

# Configuration profiles are commonly identified via their identifer
# and a unique UUID. This value is used as the basis.
# It's recommended to use reverse DNS notation for an identifier.
# For example, a SSL certificate may end up with an
# identifier of "com.example.corp.mdm.corporate-ca".
#
# Format example: com.example.corp.mdm
base_identifier = "com.example.corp.mdm"
# The name of your organization. This will be displayed
# as the organization on all profiles, and used on certificates.
#
# Format example: "Contoso Corporation"
organization_name = "Contoso Corporation"
# The name of your root CA, used to issue SSL and device CA.
#
# If not specified, it defaults to "{org_name} Root CA".
#root_ca_name = "Contoso Corporation Root CA"
# The name of your device CA, used for device communication.
#
# If not specified, it defaults to "{org_name} Device CA".
